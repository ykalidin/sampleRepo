# mashling/cli
> Command line tool for building **Mashling**-based gateways.

**Mashling** is a Micro-gateway framework written in Go. It was designed from the ground up to be robust enough for microservices.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
* The Go programming language 1.7 or later should be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
* Set GOPATH environment variable on your system
* In order to simplify development and building in Go, we are using the **gb** build tool.  It can be downloaded from [here](https://getgb.io).  
* For a private repo, set up ssh interaction with github. Follow the instruction [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) and run the following command  
    git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"

### Install Mashling
    go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling/cli/...

### Update Mashling
    go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling/cli/...

## Getting Started
A mashling gateway is created using the **mashling** CLI tool.  The tool can be used to create a gateway from an existing *mashling.json* or to create a simple base gateway to get you started.  In this example we will walk you through creating the base/sample gateway.

To create the base gateway, which consists of a REST trigger and a simple event handler flow with a log activity, you use the following commands.


```bash
mashling create myApp

```

- Cd myApp/bin folder
- Start mashling engine by running ./myApp
- Mashling will start a REST server
- Send GET request to run the flow. eg: http://localhost:9096/pets/1

The built in sample gateway is based of the following mashling.json.  This file can be manually modified to add additional triggers and event handlers.  This file can also be generated using the mashling-web UI.

```json
{
	"gateway": {
		"name": "demo",
		"version": "1.0.0",
		"description": "This is the first microgateway app",
		"configurations": [
			{
				"name": "kafkaConfig",
				"type": "github.com/wnichols/kafkasub",
				"description": "Configuration for kafka cluster",
				"settings": {
					"BrokerUrl": "localhost:9092"
				}
			}
		],
		"triggers": [

					"port": "9096",
					"method": "GET",
					"path": "/pets/:petId"
				}
			}
		],
		"event_handlers": [
			{
				"name": "get_pet_success_handler",
				"description": "Handle the user access",
				"reference": "github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling/lib/flow/flogo.json",
				"params": {
					"uri": "petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/3"
				}
			}
		],
		"event_links": [
			{
				"triggers": [
					"rest_trigger"
				],
				"dispatches": [
					{
						"if": "trigger.content != undefined",
						"handler": "get_pet_success_handler"
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
```
